Revision history for Perinci-Tx-Manager

0.48     2014-05-01 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Bump prereq version to avoid fail reports [CT].


0.47     2014-03-31 (SHARYANTO)

         [INTERNAL]

         - Change all methods (including internal ones) to return enveloped
           result, so we can better return previous errors, for
           tracing/debugging.


0.46     2014-03-30 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Some minor updates.


0.45     2013-09-08 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Update to Perinci::Access::Schemeless (which
           replaces Perinci::Access::InProcess).


0.44     2012-12-21 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Remove circular dependency because we depended
           on Perinci::Examples and it in turn depends on Perinci::CmdLine
           (which depends on us) [RT#81996]. Also fix test (fix function
           metadata for unsetval(), bug uncovered now that we have functioning
           argument validation).


0.43     2012-10-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - Can now load functions from main:: or already-loaded package.

0.41     2012-09-05 (SHARYANTO)

0.40     2012-09-04 (SHARYANTO)

         - Tweak log level for check_state status 200 message (debug instead of
           info).


0.39     2012-09-04 (SHARYANTO)

         - Allow function to skip logging check_state status 200 message by
           using empty string.

0.34     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - test_tx_action(): Add 'before_undo' parameter for testing change of
           state between do and undo.

         - Nicer error message for undo() & redo(), like action().


0.33     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - Pass special arguments to functions: '-tx_recovery' => 1 when during
           recovery, and '-tx_rollback' => 1 when during rollback, for
           informative purposes.


0.32     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - Implement confirmation (Rinci 1.1.27). Pass 'confirm' => 1 to action()
           to pass '-confirm' special argument to function.


0.31     2012-08-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Fix bug in recovery of crashed redo. Add more
           tests.


0.30     2012-08-24 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Now follow Rinci 1.1.26 (transaction protocol version bumped to v=2,
           no longer uses undo protocol).

         - Database format changed from v=4 to v=5, due some tables being
           renamed.

         - Various other small fixes.


0.29     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Now follow Rinci 1.1.23, no more steps, everything is function.

         - Database format changed from v=3 to v=4, old format cannot be
           converted to new.

         [ETC]

         - Tests have not been adjusted (taken from Perinci::Access::InProcess),
           but so far Perinci::Sub::Gen::Undoable and File::Trash::Undoable
           already work with this new version.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
           growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
