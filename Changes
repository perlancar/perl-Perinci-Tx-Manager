Revision history for Perinci-Tx-Manager

0.29     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Now follow Rinci 1.1.23, no more steps, everything is function.

         - Database format changed from v=3 to v=4, old format cannot be
           converted to new.

         [ETC]

         - Tests have not been adjusted (taken from Perinci::Access::InProcess),
           but so far Perinci::Sub::Gen::Undoable and File::Trash::Undoable
           already work with this new version.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
         growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
